# Fake Store Cart API
The functionalities I implemented 
* Get all (GET request)
* Get a single (GET request)
* Get in date range (GET request)
* Get user cart (GET request)
* Add new cart (POST request)
* Update a cart (PUT request)
* Delete a cart (DELETE request)

### To run this in your system just clone the repo and open it in your IDE of choice and start the server. Then by using Postman sent API calls and see the results. 
### I have attacthed an the images of the Postman testing of my API endpoints in the Images folder.
